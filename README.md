## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system

  

## Prerequisites

* Download the [Expo](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/expo-client/id982107779?mt=8) application from App store to your mobile device.

* Run `npm install` after cloning to download all dependencies

* Use `expo start` to build the React Native application, once successfully built the expo simulator will open in your web browser.

```

1. confirm that the 'LAN' tab is selected.

2. confirm that your mobile and PC are connected to te same network.

3. Scan the QR code with your mobile device (You will receive a Expo notification).

4. Select the notification for the Expo application to begin building the app for use.

```

  

## Built With

* JavaScript

* React

* React Native

* Redux

* Expo

* Expo Three

  

# Project Aim

The aim of this project is to allow customers of restaurants to interact and visualise a 3D representation of their order.
Upon order completion, users can opt to register their name and number to receive an SMS notification once their order is ready for collection.

  

# Features

* 3D Objects

* Touch-press 3D object interaction

* Twilio implementation

* Scalable Features

    

# Challenges



* Expo AR is relatively new and still in its staging process.

* Expo AR and React Native compatibility.

* Poor Expo AR documentation and online material/resources.

* Implementing GooglePoly Api to work with Expo AR

* Implementing the THREE package

* Using the [Qlone](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/qlone-3d-scanning-solution/id1229460906?mt=8) app to load our own 3D Objects



# Testing

Currently, We could not complete testing due to some tehnical conflicts with the technoligies used.
The issues arise from the current React Native version not being stable with Jest and 


# Next Steps

Though, the app is in a stable and complete state, there are still functional features and processes we plan to roll-out.

We plan to;
```

- Scan and implement our own 3D objects

- Find a fix for React Native testing

```

# Troubleshooting

* If Object does not display, check the following:
-Tap your mobile device's screen
-Your Expo simulator on PC is running


* Did not receive Twilo response, check the following:
-You are connected to the internet
 -Entered the correct number
-Your number is registered with Twilo
